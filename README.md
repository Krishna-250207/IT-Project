An Employee Management System (EMS) is one of the software applications through which a business can systematically manage its workforce. There are various HR functions automatically and efficiently streamlined, and these include employee records maintenance, attendance tracking, payrolls, performance evaluation, and benefits administration.

Principal features of an EMS most often include:

Employee information: Centralized storage containing personal and professional details of each employee.
Attendance and Time Tracking: Monitoring working hours, absences, or overtime.
Payroll: computation of salaries, deductions, bonuses, and taxes.
Leave Management: Tracking and approval of the leave requests of employees.
Performance Management: Setting goals, reviewing performance, and appraisal management.
Reporting and Analytics: Generation of reports on performance, attendance, and other things by an employee.
An EMS minimizes administrative work, thereby increasing accuracy, productivity, and compliance with legal regulations.
